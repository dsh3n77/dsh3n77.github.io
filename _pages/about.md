<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Michigan State University, co-advised by Prof. Jiliang Tang and Prof. Hui Liu. Prior to this, I received my bachelor’s degree from the School of Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research interests lie in AI Agents and Trustworthy AI, and I am devoted to developing intelligent agent systems that are both capable and reliable..
