<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Michigan State University, co-advised by Prof. Jiliang Tang and Prof. Hui Liu. Prior to this, I received my bachelor‚Äôs degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), School of Mathematics.

I study Agentic and Trustworthy AI. I am devoted to developing intelligent agent systems that are both capable and reliable.
